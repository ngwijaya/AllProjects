## Overview
### 1. Amazon Product Ratings and Reviews EDA
#### Description: 
This project explores Amazon product data — including product details, prices, ratings, and customer reviews — to uncover insights about consumer behavior and product performance. The dataset contains information such as product ID, name, category, discounted and actual prices, ratings, number of reviews, review text, and user information.

#### Background: 
Customer reviews and pricing strategies play a major role in how products perform on e-commerce platforms. By analyzing this data, we can better understand how discounts, ratings, and customer sentiment influence sales and product success.

#### Project Objective: 
The goal of this exploratory analysis is to identify patterns in pricing and discounting, compare performance across categories, and explore the relationship between customer reviews and overall product ratings.

#### Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning** - Load the dataset, explore its structure, and handle missing or inconsistent values.
2. **Data Wrangling** - Standardize currency and percentage fields, engineer new helper features, and create summaries that make analysis easier.
3. **Data Visualization** - Use charts and plots to tell the story behind pricing trends, category performance, and customer sentiment.
4. **Model Building** - Build a simple baseline model to predict product ratings using variables like discounts, categories, and review sentiment.
